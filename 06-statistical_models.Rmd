# Statistical models

In this chapter, we will not learn about all the models out there that you may or may not need.
Instead, I will show you how can use what you have learned until now and how you can apply these
concepts to modeling. Also, as you read in the beginning of the book, R has many many packages. So
the model you need is most probably already implemented in some package and you will very likely
not need to write your own from scratch. 

In the first section, I will discuss the terminology used in this book. Then I will discuss 
linear regression; showing how linear regression works illsutrates very well how other models
work too, without loss of generality. Then I will introduce the concepte of hyper-parameters
with ridge regression. This chapter will then finish with an introduction to cross-validation as 
a way to tune the hyper-parameters of models that features them.

## Terminology

Before continuing discussing about statistical models and model fitting it is worthwhile to discuss
terminology a little bit. Depending on your background, you might call an explanatory variable a 
feature or the dependent variable the target. These are the same objects. The matrix of features
is usually called a design matrix, and what statisticians call the intercept is what
machine learning engineers call the bias. Referring to the intercept by bias is unfortunate, as bias
also has a very different meaning; bias is also what we call the error in a model that may cause
*biased* estimates. To finish up, the estimated parameters of the model may be called coefficients
or weights. Here again, I don't like the using *weight* as weight as a very different meaning in
statistics. 
So, in the remainder of this chapter, and book, I will use the terminology from the statistical 
litterature, using dependent and explanatory variables (`y` and `x`), and calling the 
estimated parameters coefficients and the intercept... well the intercept (the $\beta$s of the model). 
However, I will talk of *training* a model, instead of *estimating* a model.

## Fitting a model to data

Suppose you have a variable `y` that you wish to explain using a set of other variables `x1`, `x2`,
`x3`, etc. Let's take a look at the `Housing` dataset from the `Ecdat` package:

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(Ecdat)

data(Housing)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(Ecdat)

data(Housing)
```

You can read a description of the dataset by running:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
?Housing
```

```

or by looking for `Housing` in the help pane of RStudio. Usually, you would take a look a the data
before doing any modeling:

```{r}
glimpse(Housing)
```

Housing prices depend on a set of variables such as the number of bedrooms, the area it is located
and so on. If you believe that housing prices depend linearly on a set of explanatory variables,
you will want to estimate a linear model. To estimate a *linear model*, you will need to use the
built-in `lm()` function:

```{r}
model1 <- lm(price ~ lotsize + bedrooms, data = Housing)
```

`lm()` takes a formula as an argument, which defines the model you want to estimate. In this case,
I ran the following regression:

\[
\text{price} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 * \text{lotsize} + \beta_2 * \text{bedrooms} + \varepsilon
\]

where \(\beta_0, \beta_1\) and \(\beta_2\) are three parameters to estimate. To take a look at the
results, you can use the `summary()` method (not to be confused with `dplyr::summarise()`):

```{r}
summary(model1)
```

if you wish to remove the intercept (\(\beta_0\) in the above equation) from your model, you can 
do so with `-1`:

```{r}
model2 <- lm(price ~ -1 + lotsize + bedrooms, data = Housing)

summary(model2)
```

or if you want to use all the columns inside `Housing`, replacing the column names by `.`:

```{r}
model3 <- lm(price ~ ., data = Housing)

summary(model3)
```

You can access different elements of `model3` with `$`, because the result of `lm()` is a list:

```{r}
print(model3$coefficients)
```

but I prefer to use the `{broom}` package, and more specifically the `tidy()` function, which
converts `model3` into a neat `data.frame`:

```{r}
results3 <- broom::tidy(model3)

glimpse(results3)
```

I explicitely write `broom::tidy()` because `tidy()` is a popular function name. For instance,
it is also a function from the `{yardstick}` package, which does not do the same thing at all. Since
I will also be using `{yardstick}` I prefer to explicitely write `broom::tidy()` to avoid conflicts.

Using `broom::tidy()` is useful, because you can then work on the results easily, for example if 
you wish to only keep results that are significant at the 5\% level:

```{r}
results3 %>%
  filter(p.value < 0.05)
```

You can even add new columns, such as the confidence intervals:

```{r}
results3 <- broom::tidy(model3, conf.int = TRUE, conf.level = 0.95)

print(results3)
```

Going back to model estimation, you can of course use `lm()` in a pipe workflow:

```{r}
Housing %>%
  select(-driveway, -stories) %>%
  lm(price ~ ., data = .) %>%
  broom::tidy()
```

The first `.` in the `lm()` function is used to indicate that we wish to use all the data from `Housing`
(minus `driveway` and `stories` which I removed using `select()` and the `-` sign), and the second `.` is
used to *place* the result from the two `dplyr` instructions that preceded is to be placed there.
The picture below should help you understand:

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/pipe_to_second_position.png")
```

You have to specify this, because by default, when using `%>%` the left hand side argument gets
passed as the first argument of the function on the right hand side.

## Diagnostics

Diagnostics are useful metrics to assess model fit. You can read some of these diagnostics, such as
the \(R^2\) at the bottom of the summary (when running `summary(my_model)`), but if you want to do
more than simply reading these diagnostics from RStudio, you can put those in a `data.frame` too,
using `broom::glance()`:

```{r}
glance(model3)
```

You can also plot the usual diagnostics plots using `ggfortify::autoplot()` which uses the
`{ggplot2}` package under the hood:

```{r}
library(ggfortify)

autoplot(model3, which = 1:6) + theme_minimal()
```

`which=1:6` is an additional option that shows you all the diagnostics plot. If you omit this
option, you will only get 4 of them.

You can also get the residuals of the regression in two ways; either you grab them directly from
the model fit:

```{r}
resi3 <- residuals(model3)
```

or you can augment the original data with a residuals column, using `broom::augment()`:

```{r, include=FALSE}
housing_aug <- augment(model3)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
housing_aug <- augment(model3)
```

Let's take a look at `housing_aug`:

```{r}
glimpse(housing_aug)
```

A few columns have been added to the original data, among them `.resid` which contains the
residuals. Let's plot them:

```{r}
ggplot(housing_aug) +
  geom_density(aes(.resid))
```

Fitted values are also added to the original data, under the variable `.fitted`. It would also have
been possible to get the fitted values with:

```{r}
fit3 <- fitted(model3)
```

but I prefer using `augment()`, because the columns get merged to the original data, which then
makes it easier to find specific individuals, for example, you might want to know for which housing
units the model underestimates the price:

```{r}
total_pos <- housing_aug %>%
  filter(.resid > 0) %>%
  summarise(total = n()) %>%
  pull(total)
```

we find `r total_pos` individuals where the residuals are positive. It is also easier to
extract outliers:

```{r}
housing_aug %>%
  mutate(prank = cume_dist(.cooksd)) %>%
  filter(prank > 0.99) %>%
  glimpse()
```

`prank` is a variable I created with `cume_dist()` which is a `dplyr` function that returns the
proportion of all values less than or equal to the current rank. For example:

```{r}
example <- c(5, 4.6, 2, 1, 0.8, 0, -1)
cume_dist(example)
```

by filtering `prank > 0.99` we get the top 1% of outliers according to Cook's distance.

## Interpreting models

Model interpretation is essential in the social sciences, but it is also getting very important
in machine learning. As usual, the terminology is different; in machine learning, we speak about
explainability. There is a very important aspect that one has to understand when it comes to 
interpretability/explainability: *classical, parametric* models, and *black-box* models. This
is very well explained in @breiman2001, an absolute must read (link to paper, in PDF format:
[click here](https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.ss/1009213726)). The gist of the paper
is that there are two cultures of statistical modeling; one culture relies on modeling the data 
generating process, for instance, by considering that a variable y (independent variable, or target)
is a linear combination of input variables x (dependent variables, or features) plus some noise. The
other culture uses complex algorithms (random forests, neural networks)
to model the relationship between y and x. The author argues that most statisticians have relied
for too long on modeling data generating processes and do not use all the potential offered by 
these complex algorithms. I think that a lot of things have changed since then, and that nowadays
any practitioner that uses data is open to use any type of model or algorithm, as long as it does
the job. However, the paper is very interesting, and the discussion on trade-off between 
simplicity of the model and interpretability/explainability is still relevant today.

In this section, I will explain how one can go about interpreting or explaining models from these
two cultures.

Also, it is important to note here that the discussion that will follow will be heavily influenced
by my econometrics background. I will focus on marginal effects as way to interpret parametric
models (models from the first culture described above), but depending on the field, practitioners
might use something else (for instance by computing odds ratios in a logistic regression).

I will start by interpretability of *classical* statistical models.

### Marginal effects

If one wants to know the effect of variable `x` on the dependent variable `y`, 
marginal effects have to be computed. This is easily done in R with the `{margins}` package, which 
aims to provide the same functionality as the `margins` command in STATA:

```{r}
library(margins)

effects_model3 <- margins(model3)

summary(effects_model3)
```

It is also possible to plot the results:

```{r}
plot(effects_model3)
```

This uses the basic R plotting capabilities, which is useful because it is a simple call to the
function `plot()` but if you've been using `{ggplot2}` and want this graph to have the same feel as
the others made with `{ggplot2}` you first need to save the summary in a variable.
`summary(effects_model3)` is a `data.frame` with many details. Let's overwrite this
`effects_model3` with its summary:

```{r}
effects_model3 <- summary(effects_model3)
```

And now it is possible to use `ggplot2` to have the same plot:

```{r}
ggplot(data = effects_model3) +
  geom_point(aes(factor, AME)) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(x = factor, ymin = lower, ymax = upper)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45))
```

Of course for `model3`, the marginal effects are the same as the coefficients, so let's estimate a
logit model and compute the marginal effects. You might know logit models as *logistic regression*.
Logit models can be estimated using the `glm()` function, which stands for generalized linear
models.

As an example, we are going to use the `Participation` data, also from the `{Ecdat}` package:

```{r}
data(Participation)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
?Particpation
```

```

```

The variable of interest is `lfp`: whether the individual participates in the labour force or not. 
To know which variables are relevant in the decision to participate in the labour force, one could 
train a logit model, using `glm()`:

```{r}
logit_participation <- glm(lfp ~ ., data = Participation, family = "binomial")

broom::tidy(logit_participation)
```

From the results above, one can only interpret the sign of the coefficients. To know how much a
variable influences the labour force participation, one has to use `margins()`:

```{r}
effects_logit_participation <- margins(logit_participation) %>%
  summary()

print(effects_logit_participation)
```

We can use the previous code to plot the marginal effects:

```{r}
ggplot(data = effects_logit_participation) +
  geom_point(aes(factor, AME)) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(x = factor, ymin = lower, ymax = upper)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45))
```

So an infinitesimal increase, in say, non-labour income (`lnnlinc`) of 0.001 is associated with a
decrease of the probability of labour force participation by 0.001*17 percentage points.

You can also extract the marginal effects of a single variable:

```{r}
head(dydx(Participation, logit_participation, "lnnlinc"))
```

Which makes it possible to extract the effect for a list of individuals that you can create yourself:

```{r}
my_subjects <- tribble(
    ~lfp,  ~lnnlinc, ~age, ~educ, ~nyc, ~noc, ~foreign,
    "yes",   10.780,  7.0,     4,    1,   1,     "yes",
    "no",      1.30,  9.0,     1,    4,   1,     "yes"
)

dydx(my_subjects, logit_participation, "lnnlinc")
```

I used the `tribble()` function from the `{tibble}` package to create this test data set, row by row.
Then, using `dydx()`, I get the marginal effect of variable `lnnlinc` for these two individuals.

### Explainability of *black-box* models

Just read Christoph Molnar's 
[Interpretable Machine Learning](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/).


## Comparing models

Let's estimate another model on the same data; prices are only positive, so a linear regression
might not be the best model, because the model could predict negative prices. Let's look at the
distribution of prices:

```{r}
ggplot(Housing) +
  geom_density(aes(price))
```

it looks like modeling the log of `price` might provide a better fit:

```{r}
model_log <- lm(log(price) ~ ., data = Housing)

result_log <- broom::tidy(model_log)

print(result_log)
```

Let's take a look at the diagnostics:

```{r}
glance(model_log)
```

Let's compare these to the ones from the previous model:

```{r}
diag_lm <- glance(model3)

diag_lm <- diag_lm %>%
  mutate(model = "lin-lin model")

diag_log <- glance(model_log)

diag_log  <- diag_log %>%
  mutate(model = "log-lin model")

diagnostics_models <- full_join(diag_lm, diag_log)

print(diagnostics_models)
```

I saved the diagnostics in two different `data.frame` objects using the `glance()` function and added a
`model` column to indicate which model the diagnostics come from. Then I merged both datasets using
`full_join()`, a `{dplyr}` function.

As you can see, the model with the logarithm of the prices as the dependent variable has a higher
likelihood (and thus lower AIC and BIC) than the simple linear model. Let's take a look at the 
diagnostics plots:

```{r, include=FALSE}
summary(model_log)
```

```{r}
autoplot(model_log, which = 1:6) + theme_minimal()
```

## Using a model for prediction

Once you estimated a model, you might want to use it for prediction. This is easily done using the
`predict()` function that works with most models. Prediction is also useful as a way to test the
accuracy of your model: split your data into a training set (used for training) and a testing
set (used for the pseudo-prediction) and see if your model overfits the data. We are going to see
how to do that in a later section; for now, let's just get acquainted with `predict()` and other
functions. I insist, keep in mind that this section is only to get acquainted with these functions. 
We are going to explore prediction, overfitting and tuning of models in a later section.

Let's go back to the models we trained in the previous section, `model3` and `model_log`. Let's also
take a subsample of data, which we will be using for prediction:

```{r}
set.seed(1234)

pred_set <- Housing %>%
  sample_n(20)
```

In order to always get the same `pred_set`, I set the random seed first. Let's take a look at the
data:

```{r}
print(pred_set)
```

If we wish to use it for prediction, this is easily done with `predict()`:

```{r}
predict(model3, pred_set)
```

This returns a vector of predicted prices. This can then be used to compute the Root Mean Squared Error
for instance. Let's do it within a `tidyverse` pipeline:

```{r}
rmse <- pred_set %>%
  mutate(predictions = predict(model3, .)) %>%
  summarise(sqrt(sum(predictions - price)**2/n()))
```

The root mean square error of `model3` is `r rmse`. 

I also used the `n()` function which returns the number of observations in a group (or all the
observations, if the data is not grouped). Let's compare `model3` 's RMSE with the one from
`model_log`:

```{r}
rmse2 <- pred_set %>%
  mutate(predictions = exp(predict(model_log, .))) %>%
  summarise(sqrt(sum(predictions - price)**2/n()))
```

Don't forget to exponentiate the predictions, remember you're dealing with a log-linear model! `model_log`'s
RMSE is `r rmse2` which is lower than `model3`'s. However, keep in mind that the model was trained
on the whole data, and then the prediction quality was assessed using a subsample of the data the
model was trained on... so actually we can't really say if `model_log`'s predictions are very useful.
Of course, this is the same for `model3`.
In a later section we are going to learn how to do cross validation to avoid this issue.

Also another problem of what I did before, unrelated to statistics per se, is that I wanted to compute
the same quantity for two different models, and did so by copy and pasting 3 lines of code. That's not
much, but if I wanted to compare 10 models, copy and paste mistakes could have sneaked in. Instead,
it would have been nice to have a function that computes the RMSE and then use it on my models. We
are going to learn how to write our own function and use it just like if it was another built-in
R function.

## Beyond linear regression

R has a lot of other built-in functions for regression, such as `glm()` (for Generalized Linear
Models) and `nls()` for (for Nonlinear Least Squares). There are also functions and additional
packages for time series, panel data, machine learning, bayesian and nonparametric methods.
Presenting everything here would take too much space, and would be pretty useless as you can find
whatever you need using an internet search engine. What you have learned until now is quite general
and should work on many type of models. To help you out, here is a list of methods and the
recommended packages that you can use:

Model                      Package                                                            Quick example

I put neural networks in the table, but you can also find packages for regression trees, naive
bayes, and pretty much any machine learning method out there! The same goes for Bayesian methods.
Popular packages include `{rstan}`, `{rjags}` which link R to STAN and JAGS (two other pieces of software
that do the Gibbs sampling for you) which are tools that allow you to fit very general models. It
is also possible to train models using Bayesian inference without the need of external tools,
with the `{bayesm}` package which estimates the usual micro-econometric models.
There really are a lot of packages available for Bayesian inference, and you can find them all in the
[related CRAN Task View](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Bayesian.html).

## Hyper-parameters

Hyper-parameters are parameters of the model that cannot be directly learned from the data. 
A linear regression does not have any hyper-parameters, but a random forest for instance has several.
You might have heard of ridge regression, lasso and elasticnet. These are 
extensions of linear models that avoid over-fitting by penalizing *large* models. These 
extensions of the linear regression have hyper-parameters that the practitioner has to tune. There
are several ways one can tune these parameters, for example, by doing a grid-search, or a random 
search over the grid or using more elaborate methods. To introduce hyper-parameters, let's get
to know ridge regression, also called Tikhonov regularization.

### Ridge regression

Ridge regression is used when the data you are working with has a lot of explanatory variables, 
or when there is a risk that a simple linear regression might overfit to the training data, because, 
for example, your explanatory variables are collinear. 
If you are training a linear model and then you notice that it generalizes very badly to new, 
unseen data, it is very likely that the linear model you trained overfit the data. 
In this case, ridge regression might prove useful. The way ridge regression works might seem 
counter-intuititive; it boils down to fitting a *worse* model to the training data, but in return,
this worse model will generalize better to new data.

The closed form solution of the ordinary least squares estimator is defined as:

\[
\widehat{\beta} = (X'X)^{-1}X'Y
\]

where $X$ is the design matrix (the matrix made up of the explanatory variables) and $Y$ is the
dependent variable. For ridge regression, this closed form solution changes a little bit:

\[
\widehat{\beta} = (X'X + \lambda I_p)^{-1}X'Y
\]

where $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$ is an hyper-parameter and $I_p$ is the identity matrix of dimension $p$
($p$ is the number of explanatory variables).
This formula above is the closed form solution to the following optimisation program:

\[
\sum_{i=1}^n \left(y_i - \sum_{j=1}^px_{ij}\beta_j\right)^2 
\]

such that:

\[
\sum_{j=1}^p(\beta_j)^2 < c
\]

for any strictly positive $c$.

The `glmnet()` function from the `{glmnet}` package can be used for ridge regression, by setting
the `alpha` argument to 0 (setting it to 1 would do LASSO, and setting it to a number between 
0 and 1 would do elasticnet). But in order to compare linear regression and ridge regression, 
let me first divide the data into a training set and a testing set:

```{r}
index <- 1:nrow(Housing)

set.seed(12345)
train_index <- sample(index, round(0.90*nrow(Housing)), replace = FALSE)

test_index <- setdiff(index, train_index)

train_x <- Housing[train_index, ] %>% 
    select(-price)

train_y <- Housing[train_index, ] %>% 
    pull(price)

test_x <- Housing[test_index, ] %>% 
    select(-price)

test_y <- Housing[test_index, ] %>% 
    pull(price)
```

I do the train/test split this way, because `glmnet()` requires a design matrix as input, and not
a formula. Design matrices can be created using the `model.matrix()` function:

```{r}
library("glmnet")

train_matrix <- model.matrix(train_y ~ ., data = train_x)

test_matrix <- model.matrix(test_y ~ ., data = test_x)
```

Let's now run a linear regression, by setting the penalty to 0:

```{r}
model_lm_ridge <- glmnet(y = train_y, x = train_matrix, alpha = 0, lambda = 0)
```

The model above provides the same result as a linear regression, because I set `lambda` to 0. Let's
compare the coefficients between the two:

```{r}
coef(model_lm_ridge)
```

and now the coefficients of the linear regression (because I provide a design matrix, I have to use
`lm.fit()` instead of `lm()` which requires a formula, not a matrix.)

```{r}
coef(lm.fit(x = train_matrix, y = train_y))
```

as you can see, the coefficients are the same. Let's compute the RMSE for the unpenalized linear 
regression:

```{r}
preds_lm <- predict(model_lm_ridge, test_matrix)

rmse_lm <- sqrt(mean(preds_lm - test_y)^2)
```

The RMSE for the linear unpenalized regression is equal to `r rmse_lm`.

Let's now run a ridge regression, with `lambda` equal to 100, and see if the RMSE is smaller:

```{r}
model_ridge <- glmnet(y = train_y, x = train_matrix, alpha = 0, lambda = 100)
```

and let's compute the RMSE again:

```{r}
preds <- predict(model_ridge, test_matrix)

rmse <- sqrt(mean(preds - test_y)^2)
```

The RMSE for the linear penalized regression is equal to `r rmse`, which is smaller than before.
But which value of `lambda` gives smallest RMSE? To find out, one must run model over a grid of
`lambda` values and pick the model with lowest RMSE. This procedure is available in the `cv.glmnet()`
function, which picks the best value for `lambda`:

```{r}
best_model <- cv.glmnet(train_matrix, train_y)
# lambda that minimises the MSE
best_model$lambda.min
```

According to `cv.glmnet()` the best value for `lambda` is `r best_model$lambda.min`. In the 
next section, we will implement cross validation ourselves, in order to find the hyper-parameters
of a random forest.

## Training, validating, and testing models

Cross-validation is an important procedure which is used to compare models but also to tune the
hyper-parameters of a model. In this section, we are going to use several packages from the
[`{tidymodels}`](https://github.com/tidymodels) collection of packages, namely
[`{recipes}`](https://tidymodels.github.io/recipes/), 
[`{rsample}`](https://tidymodels.github.io/rsample/) and 
[`{parsnip}`](https://tidymodels.github.io/parsnip/) to train a random forest the tidy way. I will
also use [`{mlrMBO}`](http://mlrmbo.mlr-org.com/) to tune the hyper-parameters of the random forest.

### Set up

Let's load the needed packages:

```{r, include=FALSE}
library("tidyverse")
library("recipes")
library("rsample")
library("parsnip")
library("yardstick")
library("brotools")
library("mlbench")
```


```{r, eval=FALSE}
library("tidyverse")
library("recipes")
library("rsample")
library("parsnip")
library("yardstick")
library("brotools")
library("mlbench")
```

Load the data which is included in the `{mlrbench}` package:

```{r}
data("BostonHousing2")
```

I will train a random forest to predict the housing prices, which is the `cmedv` column:

```{r}
head(BostonHousing2)
```

Only keep relevant columns:

```{r}
boston <- BostonHousing2 %>% 
    select(-medv, -tract, -lon, -lat) %>% 
    rename(price = cmedv)
```

I remove `tract`, `lat` and `lon` because the information contained in the column `town` is enough.

To train and evaluate the model's performance, I split the data in two. 
One data set, called the training set, will be further split into two down below. I won't 
touch the second data set, the test set, until the very end, to finally assess the model's 
performance.

```{r}
train_test_split <- initial_split(boston, prop = 0.9)

housing_train <- training(train_test_split)

housing_test <- testing(train_test_split)
```

`initial_split()`, `training()` and `testing()` are functions from the `{rsample}` package.

I will train a random forest on the training data, but the question, is *which* random forest?
Because random forests have several hyper-parameters, and as explained in the intro these 
hyper-parameters cannot be directly learned from the data, which one should we choose? We could
train 6 random forests for instance and compare their performance, but why only 6? Why not 16? 

In order to find the right hyper-parameters, the practitioner can 
use values from the literature that seemed to have worked well (like is done in Macro-econometrics)
or you can further split the train set into two, create a grid of hyperparameter, train the model 
on one part of the data for all values of the grid, and compare the predictions of the models on the 
second part of the data. You then stick with the model that performed the best, for example, the 
model with lowest RMSE. The thing is, you can't estimate the true value of the RMSE with only
one value. It's like if you wanted to estimate the height of the population by drawing one single
observation from the population. You need a bit more observations. To approach the true value of the
RMSE for a give set of hyperparameters, instead of doing one split, let's do 30. Then we
compute the average RMSE, which implies training 30 models for each combination of the values of the 
hyperparameters.

First, let's split the training data again, using the `mc_cv()` function from `{rsample}` package.
This function implements Monte Carlo cross-validation:

```{r}
validation_data <- mc_cv(housing_train, prop = 0.9, times = 30)
```

What does `validation_data` look like?

```{r}
validation_data
```

Let's look further down:

```{r}
validation_data$splits[[1]]
```

The first value is the number of rows of the first set, the second value of the second, and the third
was the original amount of values in the training data, before splitting again.

How should we call these two new data sets? The author of `{rsample}`, Max Kuhn, talks about 
the *analysis* and the *assessment* sets, and I'm going to use this terminology as well.

```{r, echo=FALSE, include = FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode("tweet", "1066131042615140353")
```

Now, in order to continue I need to pre-process the data. I will do this in three steps.
The first and the second steps are used to center and scale the numeric variables and the third step 
converts character and factor variables to dummy variables. This is needed because I will train a 
random forest, which cannot handle factor variables directly. Let's define a recipe to do that, 
and start by pre-processing the testing set. I write a wrapper function around the recipe,
because I will need to apply this recipe to various data sets:

```{r}
simple_recipe <- function(dataset){
    recipe(price ~ ., data = dataset) %>%
        step_center(all_numeric()) %>%
        step_scale(all_numeric()) %>%
        step_dummy(all_nominal())
}
```

We have not learned yet about writing functions, and will do so in the next chapter. However, for 
now, you only need to know that you can write your own functions, and that these functions can 
take any arguments you need. In the case of the above function, which we called `simple_recipe()`,
we only need one argument, which is a dataset, and which we called `dataset`.

Once the recipe is defined, I can use the `prep()` function, which estimates the parameters from 
the data which are needed to process the data. For example, for centering, `prep()` estimates 
the mean which will then be subtracted from the variables. With `bake()` the estimates are then
applied on the data:

```{r}
testing_rec <- prep(simple_recipe(housing_test), testing = housing_test)

test_data <- bake(testing_rec, new_data = housing_test)
```

It is important to split the data before using `prep()` and `bake()`, because if not, you will 
use observations from the test set in the `prep()` step, and thus introduce knowledge from the test
set into the training data. This is called data leakage, and must be avoided. This is why it is 
necessary to first split the training data into an analysis and an assessment set, and then also 
pre-process these sets separately. However, the `validation_data` object cannot now be used with
`recipe()`, because it is not a dataframe. No worries, I simply need to write a function that extracts
the analysis and assessment sets from the `validation_data` object, applies the pre-processing, trains
the model, and returns the RMSE. This will be a big function, at the center of the analysis. 

But before that, let's run a simple linear regression, as a benchmark. For the linear regression, I will
not use any CV, so let's pre-process the training set:

```{r}
trainlm_rec <- prep(simple_recipe(housing_train), testing = housing_train)

trainlm_data <- bake(trainlm_rec, new_data = housing_train)

linreg_model <- lm(price ~ ., data = trainlm_data)

broom::augment(linreg_model, newdata = test_data) %>% 
    yardstick::rmse(price, .fitted)
```

`broom::augment()` adds the predictions to the `test_data` in a new column, `.fitted`. I won't
use this trick with the random forest, because there is no `augment()` method for random forests
from the `{ranger}` package which I'll use. I'll add the predictions to the data myself.

Ok, now let's go back to the random forest and write the big function:

```{r}
my_rf <- function(mtry, trees, split, id){
    
    analysis_set <- analysis(split)
    
    analysis_prep <- prep(simple_recipe(analysis_set), training = analysis_set)
    
    analysis_processed <- bake(analysis_prep, new_data = analysis_set)
    
    model <- rand_forest(mode = "regression", mtry = mtry, trees = trees) %>%
        set_engine("ranger", importance = 'impurity') %>%
        fit(price ~ ., data = analysis_processed)

    assessment_set <- assessment(split)
    
    assessment_prep <- prep(simple_recipe(assessment_set), testing = assessment_set)
    
    assessment_processed <- bake(assessment_prep, new_data = assessment_set)

    tibble::tibble("id" = id,
        "truth" = assessment_processed$price,
        "prediction" = unlist(predict(model, new_data = assessment_processed)))
}
```

The `rand_forest()` function is available in the `{parsnip}` package. This package provides an 
unified interface to a lot of other machine learning packages. This means that instead of having to 
learn the syntax of `range()` and `randomForest()` and, and... you can simply use the `rand_forest()`
function and change the `engine` argument to the one you want (`ranger`, `randomForest`, etc).

Let's try this function:

```{r}
results_example <- map2_df(.x = validation_data$splits,
                           .y = validation_data$id,
                           ~my_rf(mtry = 3, trees = 200, split = .x, id = .y))

```

```{r}
head(results_example)
```

I can now compute the RMSE when `mtry` = 3 and `trees` = 200:

```{r}
results_example %>%
    group_by(id) %>%
    yardstick::rmse(truth, prediction) %>%
    summarise(mean_rmse = mean(.estimate)) %>%
    pull
```

The random forest has already lower RMSE than the linear regression. The goal now is to lower this
RMSE by tuning the `mtry` and `trees` hyperparameters. For this, I will use Bayesian Optimization
methods implemented in the `{mlrMBO}` package.

### Bayesian hyperparameter optimization

I will re-use the code from above, and define a function that does everything from pre-processing
to returning the metric I want to minimize by tuning the hyperparameters, the RMSE:

```{r}
tuning <- function(param, validation_data){

    mtry <- param[1]
    trees <- param[2]

    results <- purrr::map2_df(.x = validation_data$splits,
                       .y = validation_data$id,
                       ~my_rf(mtry = mtry, trees = trees, split = .x, id = .y))

    results %>%
        group_by(id) %>%
        yardstick::rmse(truth, prediction) %>%
        summarise(mean_rmse = mean(.estimate)) %>%
        pull
}
```

This is exactly the code from before, but it now returns the RMSE. Let's try the function
with the values from before:

```{r}
tuning(c(3, 200), validation_data)
```

I now follow the code that can be found in the [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03373) paper to 
run the optimization. A simpler model, called the surrogate model, is used to look for promising 
points and to evaluate the value of the function at these points. This seems somewhat similar 
(in spirit) to the *Indirect Inference* method as described in 
[Gourieroux, Monfort, Renault](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2285076).

If you don't really get what follows, no worries, it is not really important as such. The idea
is simply to look for hyper-parameters in an efficient way, and bayesian optimisation provides
this efficient way. However, you could use another method, for example a grid search. This would not
change anything to the general approach. So I will not spend too much time explaining what is 
going on below, as you can read the details in the paper cited above as well as the package's 
documentation. The focus here is not on this particular method, but rather showing you how you can
use various packages to solve a data science problem.

Let's first load the package and create the function to optimize:

```{r, include=FALSE}
library("mlrMBO")
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library("mlrMBO")
```

```{r}
fn <- makeSingleObjectiveFunction(name = "tuning",
                                 fn = tuning,
                                 par.set = makeParamSet(makeIntegerParam("x1", lower = 3, upper = 8),
                                                        makeIntegerParam("x2", lower = 100, upper = 500)))
```

This function is based on the function I defined before. The parameters to optimize are also 
defined as are their bounds. I will look for `mtry` between the values of 3 and 8, and `trees` 
between 50 and 500.

We still need to define some other objects before continuing:

```{r}
# Create initial random Latin Hypercube Design of 10 points
library(lhs)# for randomLHS
des <- generateDesign(n = 5L * 2L, getParamSet(fn), fun = randomLHS)
```

Then we choose the surrogate model, a random forest too:

```{r}
# Specify kriging model with standard error estimation
surrogate <- makeLearner("regr.ranger", predict.type = "se", keep.inbag = TRUE)
```

Here I define some options:

```{r}
# Set general controls
ctrl <- makeMBOControl()
ctrl <- setMBOControlTermination(ctrl, iters = 10L)
ctrl <- setMBOControlInfill(ctrl, crit = makeMBOInfillCritEI())
```

And this is the optimization part:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Start optimization
result <- mbo(fn, des, surrogate, ctrl, more.args = list("validation_data" = validation_data))
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
result <- readRDS("random_forest_estimation.rds")
```

```{r}
result
```

So the recommended parameters are `r result$x$x1` for `mtry` and `r result$x$x2` for `trees`. The
user can access these recommended parameters with `result$x$x1` and `result$x$x2`.
The value of the RMSE is lower than before, and equals `r result$y`. It can be accessed with 
`result$y`.
Let's now train the random forest on the training data with this values. First, I pre-process the 
training data

```{r}
training_rec <- prep(simple_recipe(housing_train), testing = housing_train)

train_data <- bake(training_rec, new_data = housing_train)
```

Let's now train our final model and predict the prices:

```{r}
final_model <- rand_forest(mode = "regression", mtry = result$x$x1, trees = result$x$x2) %>%
        set_engine("ranger", importance = 'impurity') %>%
        fit(price ~ ., data = train_data)

price_predict <- predict(final_model, new_data = select(test_data, -price))
```

Let's transform the data back and compare the predicted prices to the true ones visually:

```{r}
cbind(price_predict * sd(housing_train$price) + mean(housing_train$price), 
      housing_test$price)
```

Let's now compute the RMSE:

```{r}
tibble::tibble("truth" = test_data$price,
        "prediction" = unlist(price_predict)) %>% 
    yardstick::rmse(truth, prediction)
```

As I mentioned above, all the part about looking for hyper-parameters could be changed to something
else. The general approach though remains what I have described, and can be applied for any models
that have hyper-parameters.
