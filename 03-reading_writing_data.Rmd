# Reading and writing data

In this chapter, we are going to import example datasets that are available in R, `mtcars` and
`iris`. I have converted these datasets into several formats. Download those datasets
[here](https://github.com/b-rodrigues/modern_R/tree/master/datasets) if you want to follow the
examples below. R can import some formats without the need of external packages, such as the `.csv`
format. However, for other formats, you will need to use different packages. Because there are a
lot of different formats available I suggest you use the `{rio}` package. 
`{rio}` is a wrapper around different packages that import/export data in different formats. 
This package is nice because you don't need to remember which package to use to import, say, 
STATA datasets and then you need to remember which one for SAS datasets, and so on. Read `{rio}`'s
[vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rio/vignettes/rio.html) for more details. Below
I show some of `{rio}`'s functions presented in the vignette. It is also possible to import data from
other, less "traditional" sources, such as your clipboard. Also note that it is possible to import
more than one dataset at once. There are two ways of doing that, either by importing all the 
datasets, binding their rows together and add a new variable with the name of the data, or import
all the datasets into a list, where each element of that list is a data frame. We are going to 
explore this second option later.

## The swiss army knife of data import and export: `{rio}`

To import data with `{rio}`, `import()` is all you need:

```{r}
library(rio)

mtcars <- import("datasets/mtcars.csv")
```

```{r}
head(mtcars)
```

`import()` needs the path to the data, and you can specify additional options if needed. On a
Windows computer, you have to pay attention to the path; you cannot simply copy and paste it, because
paths in Windows use the `\` symbol whereas R uses `/` (just like on Linux or macOS).
Importing a STATA or a SAS file is done just the same:

```{r}
mtcars_stata <- import("datasets/mtcars.dta")
head(mtcars_stata)

mtcars_sas <- import("datasets/mtcars.sas7bdat")
head(mtcars_sas)
```

It is also possible to import Excel files where each sheet is a single table, but you will need
`import_list()` for that. The file `multi.xlsx` has two sheets, each with a table in it:

```{r}
multi <- import_list("datasets/multi.xlsx")
str(multi)
```

As you can see `multi` is a list of datasets. Told you lists were very flexible! It is also possible
to import all the datasets in a single directory at once. For this, you first need a vector of paths:

```{r}
paths <- Sys.glob("datasets/unemployment/*.csv")
```

`Sys.glob()` allows you to find files using a regular expression. "datasets/unemployment/*.csv"
matches all the `.csv` files inside the "datasets/unemployment/" folder.

```{r}
all_data <- import_list(paths)

str(all_data)
```

in a subsequent chapter we will learn how to actually use these lists of datasets.

If you know that each dataset in each file has the same columns, you can also import them directly
into a single dataset by binding each dataset together using `rbind = TRUE`:

```{r}
bind_data <- import_list(paths, rbind = TRUE)
str(bind_data)
```

This also adds a further column called `_file` indicating the name of the file that contained the
original data.

If something goes wrong, you might need to take a look at the underlying function `{rio}` is
actually using to import the file. Let's look at the following example:

```{r}
testdata <- import("datasets/problems/mtcars.csv")

head(testdata)
```

as you can see, the import didn't work quite well! This is because the separator is the `&` for
some reason. Because we are trying to read a `.csv` file, `rio::import()` is using
`data.table::fread()` under the hood (you can read this in `import()`'s help). If you then read
`data.table::fread()`'s help, you see that the `fread()` function has an optional `sep = ` argument
that you can use to specify the separator. You can use this argument in `import()` too, and it will
be passed down to `data.table::fread()`:

```{r}
testdata <- import("datasets/problems/mtcars.csv", sep = "&")

head(testdata)
```

`export()` allows you to write data to disk, by simply providing the path and name of the file you
wish to save.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
export(testdata, "path/where/to/save/testdata.csv")
```

If you end the name with `.csv` the file is exported to the csv format, if instead you write `.dta`
the data will be exported to the STATA format, and so on.

If you wish to export to Excel, this is possible, but it may require that you change a file on your
computer (you only have to do this once). Try running:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
export(testdata, "path/where/to/save/testdata.xlsx")
```

if this results in an error, try the following:

* Run the following lines in Rstudio:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
if(!file.exists("~/.Rprofile")) # only create if not already there
    file.create("~/.Rprofile")    # (don't overwrite it)
file.edit("~/.Rprofile")
```

These lines, taken shamelessly from [Efficient R
programming](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/3-3-r-startup.html#rprofile) (go read it,
it's a very great resource) look for and open the `.Rprofile` file which is a file that is run
every time you open Rstudio. This means that you can put any line of code there that will always be
executed whenever you launch Rstudio. 

* Add this line to the file:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
Sys.setenv("R_ZIPCMD" = "C:/Program Files (x86)/Rtools/zip.exe")
```

This tells Rstudio to use `zip.exe` as the default zip tool, which is needed to export files to the
Excel format. Try it out by restarting Rstudio, and then running the following lines:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(rio)

data(mtcars)

export(mtcars, "mtcars.xlsx")
```

You should find the `mtcars.xlsx` inside your working directory. You can check what is your working
directory with `getwd()`.

`{rio}` should cover all your needs, but if not, there is very likely a package out there that will
import the data you need.

## Writing any object to disk

`{rio}` is an amazing package, but is only able to write tabular representations of data. What if you
would like to save, say, a list containing any arbitrary object? This is possible with the
`saveRDS()` function. Literally anything can be saved with `saveRDS()`:

```{r}
my_list <- list("this is a list",
                list("which contains a list", 12),
                c(1, 2, 3, 4),
                matrix(c(2, 4, 3, 1, 5, 7),
                       nrow = 2))

str(my_list)
```

`my_list` is a list containing a string, a list which contains a string and a number, a vector and
a matrix... Now suppose that computing this list takes a very long time. For example, imagine that
each element of the list is the result of estimating a very complex model on a simulated
dataset, which takes hours to run. Because this takes so long to compute, you'd want to save
it to disk. This is possible with `saveRDS()`:

```{r}
saveRDS(my_list, "my_list.RDS")
```

The next day, after having freshly started your computer and launched RStudio, it is possible to
retrieve the object exactly like it was using `readRDS()`:

```{r}
my_list <- readRDS("my_list.RDS")

str(my_list)
```

Even if you want to save a regular dataset, using `saveRDS()` might be a good idea because the data
gets compressed if you add the option `compress = TRUE` to `saveRDS()`. However keep in mind that
this will only be readable by R, so if you need to share this data with colleagues that use another
tool, save it in another format.

## Using RStudio projects to manage paths

Managing paths can be painful, especially if you're collaborating with a colleague and both of you
saved the data in paths that are different. Whenever one of you wants to work on the script, the
path will need to be adapted first. The best way to avoid that is to use projects with RStudio.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/rstudio_projects.gif")
```

Imagine that you are working on a project entitled "housing". You will create a folder called
"housing" somewhere on your computer and inside this folder have another folder called "data", then
a bunch of other folders containing different files or the outputs of your analysis. What matters
here is that you have a folder called "data" which contains the datasets you will ananlyze. When
you are inside an RStudio project, granted that you chose your "housing" folder as the folder to
host the project, you can read the data by simply specifying the path like so:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
my_data <- import("/data/data.csv")
```

Constrast this to what you would need to write if you were not using a project:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
my_data <- import("C:/My Documents/Castor/Work/Projects/Housing/data/data.csv")
```

Not only is that longer, but if Castor is working on this project with Pollux, Pollux would need
to change the above line to this:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
my_data <- import("C:/My Documents/Pollux/Work/Projects/Housing/data/data.csv")
```

whenever Pollux needs to work on it. Another, similar issue, is that if you need to write something
to disk, such as a dataset or a plot, you would also need to specify the whole path:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
export(my_data, "C:/My Documents/Pollux/Work/Projects/Housing/data/data.csv")
```

If you forget to write the whole path, then the dataset will be saved in the standard working
directory, which is your "My Documents" folder on Windows, and "Home" on GNU+Linux or macOS. You
can check what is the working directory with the `getwd()` function:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
getwd()
```

On a fresh session on my computer this returns:

```
"/home/bruno"
```

or, on Windows:

```
"C:/Users/Bruno/Documents"
```

but if you call this function inside a project, it will return the path to your project. It is also
possible to set the working directory with `setwd()`, so you don't need to always write the full
path, meaning that you can this:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
setwd("the/path/I/want/")

import("data/my_data.csv")

export(processed_data, "processed_data.xlsx")
```

instead of:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
import("the/path/I/want/data/my_data.csv")

export(processed_data, "the/path/I/want/processed_data.xlsx")
```

However, I really, really, really urge you never to use `setwd()`. Use projects instead!
Using projects saves a lot of pain in the long run.
